# ActionDirectories

[`ActionDirectories`] completes directories.

```go
carapace.ActionDirectories()
```

> When used in a static way [`ActionDirectories`] uses the shell's own functionality to complete directories, but within a [callback action](./actionCallback.md) it does it itself. Thus there might be slight differences during completion.
